These files colletively perform the "hello world" of map reduce.

mapper.py: from standard in, parses out words into keys and values, prints to standard out
reducer.py: takes resuls from mapper (at command line needs to be sorted), and summarizes the word count
chapter1.txt: a random text file containing words to summarize.
